# Schulte-Game
The Schulte Grid Game is a Python-based cognitive training game built using Kivy, designed to enhance visual perception, attention, and reaction speed. Players are required to tap numbers from 1 to 9 in ascending order as quickly as possible while the game records their completion time.

This game is inspired by the Schulte Table, a well-known psychological tool used for attention and speed training, commonly used in brain exercises and vision therapy.
